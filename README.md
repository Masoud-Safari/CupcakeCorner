# CupcakeCorner: A Delicious SwiftUI App

## Introduction

CupcakeCorner is a comprehensive SwiftUI app designed to simulate an online cupcake ordering system. Developed as part of my exploration into SwiftUI and networking in Swift, this project focuses on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for placing orders, handling form data, and managing network requests.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** CupcakeCorner lets users choose their favorite cupcake flavor, quantity, and special decorations before placing an order. The app includes validation checks to ensure that no fields are left empty. After an order is placed, it communicates with a mock server to process the order and provides a confirmation to the user.
- **Technologies Used:** Built entirely with SwiftUI, this app leverages Combine for handling network requests and decoding JSON data efficiently. It demonstrates the use of forms, navigation, asynchronous functions, and state management in SwiftUI to create a seamless ordering process.

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with SwiftUI, particularly in building forms and integrating network communication within an iOS app. It served as an opportunity to understand how to manage state across multiple views and handle user input effectively.
- **Skills Gained:** This project enhanced my understanding of SwiftUI's powerful UI capabilities, networking in Swift, JSON handling, using asynchronous functions, and the importance of providing feedback to users through the UI. It also improved my problem-solving skills in developing functional and user-friendly iOS applications.
